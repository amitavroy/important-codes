This folder contains some scripts which we can run to manage EC2 instances.


1. Start EC2 instances - this can be used to create a Lamda function along with CloudWatch to start an instance at a particular time.

NOTE: Requires the policy to be added for Lamda function to have the permission to start and stop instances.
